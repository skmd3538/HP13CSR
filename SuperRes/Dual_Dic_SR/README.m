% OVERVIEW:
% 
%   These MATLAB programs implement the Image Super-Resolution Algorithm via 
%   Dual Dictionary Learnning and Sparse Represenation as described in paper:
%   
%     J. Zhang, C. Zhao, R. Xiong, S. Ma, D. Zhao "Image Super-Resolution via 
%     Dual-Dictionary  Learning and Sparse Representation" in IEEE International 
%     Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS2012),pp. 1688¨C1691, Seoul, Korea, May 2012. 
%
%   Specifically, this code reproduces the experiment results of the
%   above paper (Table 1). The code for these is:
% 
%                            Run_Demo.m
%   
%   This code relies on
%   K-SVD Toolbox (http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ronrubin/software.html)
%   All will need to reside within the current MATLAB search path.
% 
%   Note that, since most of this code relies on random projections,
%   the results produced may differ slightly in appearance and
%   value from those of the paper.
